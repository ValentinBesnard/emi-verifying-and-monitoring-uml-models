# Unified Verification and Monitoring of Executable UML Specifications

This repository contains the formalization in Lean (https://leanprover.github.io/) of:
- our Semantic Transition Relation (STR) interface
- our EMI2STR adapter used to implement the STR interface with our model interpreter interface
- our synchronous composition operator
- our operator used to add implicit transitions

The Lean code provided in the formalization.lean is machine-checkable. To check its validity, it can be loaded in the Web editor of Lean at https://leanprover.github.io/live/latest/.
